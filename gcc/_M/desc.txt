Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make describing the dependencies of the main source file.  The
preprocessor outputs one make rule containing the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files, including
those coming from -include or -imacros command line options.

Unless specified explicitly (with -MT or -MQ), the object file name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file
suffix and with any leading directory parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using \-newline.  The
rule has no commands.

This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as -dM.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you should
explicitly specify the dependency output file with -MF, or use an environment variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT.  Debug output will still be sent to the
regular output stream as normal.

Passing -M to the driver implies -E, and suppresses warnings with an implicit -w.

test:
gcc -M test.c
