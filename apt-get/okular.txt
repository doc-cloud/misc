okular

Since "A regression in KDE 4.14 prevents these applications from working fine out of the box outside of KDE" you have to install:

kdelibs-bin
kdelibs5-data
kdelibs5-plugins

That will prevent okular to report No ksycoca4 database available! and other KDE related errors.

For the standard icon theme "oxygen" not found! error message, you can istall the oxygen-icon-theme package.

All in one line:

sudo apt install kdelibs-bin kdelibs5-data kdelibs5-plugins oxygen-icon-theme
